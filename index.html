        1. You must be the primary account holder of an eligible Wells Fargo
        consumer account with a FICO® Score available, and enrolled in Wells
        Fargo Online®. Eligible Wells Fargo consumer accounts include deposit,
        loan, and credit accounts, but other consumer accounts may also be
        eligible. Contact Wells Fargo for details. Availability may be affected
        by your mobile carrier’s coverage area. Your mobile carrier's message
        and data rates may apply. Please note that the score provided under this
        service is for educational purposes and may not be the score used by
        Wells Fargo to make credit decisions. Wells Fargo looks at many factors
        to determine your credit options; therefore, a specific FICO® Score or
        Wells Fargo credit rating does not guarantee a specific loan rate,
        approval of a loan, or an upgrade on a credit card. 2. Enrollment with
        Zelle® through Wells Fargo Online® or Wells Fargo Business Online® is
        required. Terms and conditions apply. U.S. checking or savings account
        required to use Zelle®. Transactions between enrolled users typically
        occur in minutes. For your protection, Zelle® should only be used for
        sending money to friends, family, or others you trust. Neither Wells
        Fargo nor Zelle® offers purchase protection for payments made with
        Zelle® - for example, if you do not receive the item you paid for or the
        item is not described or as you expected. The Request feature within
        Zelle® is only available through Wells Fargo using a smartphone. Payment
        requests to persons not already enrolled with Zelle® must be sent to an
        email address. To send or receive money with a small business, both
        parties must be enrolled with Zelle® directly through their financial
        institution’s online or mobile banking experience. For more information,
        view the Zelle® Transfer Service Addendum to the Wells Fargo Online
        Access Agreement. Your mobile carrier's message and data rates may
        apply. Account fees (e.g., monthly service, overdraft) may apply to
        Wells Fargo account(s) with which you use Zelle®.
